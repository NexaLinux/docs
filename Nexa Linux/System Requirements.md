# System requirements
!!!
*Don't worry, it's way better than Windows 11.*
!!!

Here, at Nexa Linux, we want to keep the nice system requirements of Arch Linux. It's not exactly the same, but it's similar. Here are the minimal and recommended system requirements:

## Minimal system requirements
RAM: 2 Gigabytes
<br>
CPU: Any x86_64 CPU

That's (probably) all.

## Recommended system requirements
RAM: 4 Gigabytes
<br>
Disk: SSD with 64GB space or more
<br>
CPU: A 64-bit Intel/AMD CPU with 2 cores or more
<br>
GPU: A GPU that can display in HD graphics.
